add all range (ABC) specific matrixes
round trip ABC matrixes

update matrix tests with latest matrices
consider intial cut in wind speed issue

build beta version

final rerun of tests (with beta verion)
automate tests

investigate inflection speed issue

LATER
experiment with interpolation method cange impact on matrices
profile?




Done:
matrix export all ranges
record % of datapoints in matrix (exclude below 0 norm wind speed)
test matrix export
export of 3D matrices
try/catch on inflection_point calc
refine/finalisation empirical/relax correction and test
restore original zero ti after relxedcorrection


Share4
experiment inclusion of density in inner range (wide range?)
