build beta version

Done:
automate tests
final rerun of tests (with beta verion)
add all range (ABC) specific matrixes
update matrix tests with latest matrices
investigate inflection speed issue
matrix export all ranges
record % of datapoints in matrix (exclude below 0 norm wind speed)
test matrix export
export of 3D matrices
try/catch on inflection_point calc
refine/finalisation empirical/relax correction and test
restore original zero ti after relxedcorrection

Share4
experiment inclusion of density in inner range (wide range?)
use augmented turbulence for values not in matrix
profile + optimise speed e.g. https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/enhancingperf.html
experiment with interpolation method cange impact on matrices
consider intial cut in wind speed issue
round trip ABC matrixes (automate)
Automate interpolation + baseline power curve tests
